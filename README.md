Former preschool teacher transitioning into education policy based quantitive analytics. 

I'm passionate about leveraging data analytics and policy research to create more equitable educational pathways. My background bridges early childhood education and quantitative analysis, focusing on how evidence-based practices can strengthen educational transitions and outcomes. 

Currently pursuing an M.A. in Education Policy at Columbia University -- I combine practical classroom experience with advanced research methods to explore how data visualization and accessible analysis can inform policy decisions. My work focuses on breaking down barriers in educational systems, particularly at critical transition points, while ensuring research and data remain accessible to all stakeholders.
